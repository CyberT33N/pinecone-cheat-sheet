# Delete your organization

If you want to delete your Pinecone organization entirely, you'll need to delete all projects, which first requires deleting all indexes and collections, and downgrade to the Starter plan.

* [Delete an index](/guides/manage-data/manage-indexes#delete-an-index)
* [Delete a project](/guides/projects/manage-projects#delete-a-project)
* [Downgrade to the Starter plan](/guides/organizations/manage-billing/manage-your-billing-plan#downgrade-to-the-starter-plan)

Once you've downgraded to the Starter plan and deleted your indexes and projects, you can delete your organization.

<Note>This action cannot be undone.</Note>

1. Go to [Settings > Manage](https://app.pinecone.io/organizations/-/settings/manage) in the Pinecone console.
2. Click **Delete this organization**.
3. Type the organization name and confirm the deletion.
