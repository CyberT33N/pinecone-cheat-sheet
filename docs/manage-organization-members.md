</Tip>

## Add a member to an organization

You can add members to your organization in the [Pinecone console](https://app.pinecone.io):

1. Go to [**Settings > Access > Members**](https://app.pinecone.io/organizations/-/settings/access/members).
2. In the **Invite by email** field, enter the member's email address.
3. Choose an [**Organization role**](/guides/assistant/admin/organizations-overview#organization-roles) for the member. The role determines the member's permissions within Pinecone.
4. Click **Invite**.

When you invite a member to join your organization, Pinecone sends them an email containing a link that enables them to gain access to the organization or project. If they already have a Pinecone account, they still receive an email, but they can also immediately view the project.

## Change a member's role

You can change a member's role in the [Pinecone console](https://app.pinecone.io):

3. Select a [**Project role**](/guides/assistant/admin/projects-overview#project-roles) for the member.
4. Click **Edit role**.
