Pinecone Support is available to customers on the **Standard** billing plan.

First-response SLAs only apply to tickets created by users in an organization subscribed to a [support plan](https://www.pinecone.io/pricing/?plans=support). To upgrade your support plan, go to [Manage your support plan](https://app.pinecone.io/organizations/-/settings/support/plans) in the console and select your desired plan. Before subscribing to a support plan, you must [Upgrade your billing plan](/guides/organizations/manage-billing/manage-your-billing-plan#upgrade-your-plan) to the **Standard** tier.

Our business hours are Monday to Friday from 8:00 AM to 8:00 PM Eastern Time. We are closed on US federal holidays. Customers subscribed to the **Pro** or **Premium** support plan have 24/7/365 on-call availability, which is triggered by creating a SEV-1 ticket.

All customers subscribed to a support plan can create tickets in the Pinecone console. To create a ticket, go to the [Help center](https://app.pinecone.io/organizations/-/settings/support/ticket), select [Create a ticket](https://app.pinecone.io/organizations/-/settings/support/ticket/create), and fill out the form.

If you are not subscribed to a support plan and need help logging into the console, upgrading your support or billing plan, or have questions about billing, please complete the [public support contact form](https://www.pinecone.io/contact/support/) and we will respond if necessary.

If you have general questions about the platform, pricing, events, and more, [contact our sales team](https://www.pinecone.io/contact/). For inquiries about partnerships, please [contact the Pinecone Partner Program](https://www.pinecone.io/partners/#sales-contact-form-submissions).
