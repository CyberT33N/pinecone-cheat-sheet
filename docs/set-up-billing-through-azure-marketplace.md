# Set up billing through Azure Marketplace

This page shows you how to configure pay-as-you-go billing for your Pinecone organization through the Azure Marketplace. To commit to annual spending, [contact Pinecone](https://www.pinecone.io/contact).

## Upgrade to a paid plan and connect to Azure

<Note>
  You must be an [organization owner](/guides/assistant/admin/organizations-overview#organization-roles) to connect your organization to a cloud marketplace.
