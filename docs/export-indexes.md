# Export indexes

Pinecone does not currently support an export or import function. It is on our roadmap for the future, however.

In the meantime, we recommend keeping a copy of your source data in case you need to move from one project to another, in which case you'll need to reindex the data.

For backup purposes, we recommend that you use collections to take periodic backups. Please see [Back up indexes](/guides/manage-data/back-up-an-index) in our documentation for more details on doing so.
