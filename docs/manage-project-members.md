# Manage project members

This page shows how to add and manage project members.

[Organization owners](/guides/assistant/admin/organizations-overview#organization-roles) or project owners can manage members in a project. Members can be added to a project with different [roles](/guides/assistant/admin/projects-overview#project-roles), which determine their permissions within the project.

<Tip>
  For information about managing members at the **organization-level**, see [Manage organization members](/guides/assistant/admin/manage-organization-members).

## Add members to a project

You can add members to a project in the [Pinecone console](https://app.pinecone.io/organizations/-/projects):

1. Select your project.
2. Go to the [**Manage > Access > Members** tab](https://app.pinecone.io/organizations/-/projects/-/access/members).
3. Enter the member's email address or name.
4. Select a [Project role](/guides/assistant/admin/projects-overview#project-roles) for the member. The role determines the member's permissions within Pinecone.
5. Click **Invite**.

When you invite a member to join your project, Pinecone sends them an email containing a link that enables them to gain access to the project. If they already have a Pinecone account, they still receive an email, but they can also immediately view the project.

## Change a member's role
